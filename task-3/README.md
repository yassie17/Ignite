## Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- You need to implement the hover state for the interactive elements on the page

- Display an error message when the form is submitted if:

  - The input field is empty

  - The email address is not formatted correctly

- The page does not need to be responsive yet.

You’ll find attached style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

And all the image and icons needed in the images
